## Dataset Information

This project uses a publicly available Kaggle sign language dataset containing labeled hand gesture images.

Due to large file sizes, datasets are not uploaded to this repository.

Dataset preprocessing includes:
- Image normalization
- Hand region (ROI) extraction
- Synthetic data generation for improved class balance

All dataset preparation steps can be reproduced using the preprocessing scripts provided in the src directory.
